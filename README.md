# Data Exploration and Preparation

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preparation
using an Indonesian recipes dataset containing both structured and textual data.
The analysis demonstrates essential data science practices for cleaning,
transforming, and preparing data for downstream analytics and modeling tasks.

## Key Tasks Performed
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values and inconsistencies
3. Feature engineering
4. Outlier detection using statistical methods (IQR)
5. Exploratory data visualization
6. Insights and data-driven observations

## Techniques Used
- Descriptive statistics
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Outlier detection using IQR
- Visualization for pattern discovery

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Dataset
- Indonesian Recipes Dataset
- Contains ingredients, preparation steps (text), and structured metadata

## Notebook
